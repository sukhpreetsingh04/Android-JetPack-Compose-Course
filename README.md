## What is Jetpack Compose?
1. It is a toolkit for building native UI.
2. It simplifies and accelerates UI development with:
    (a) Less code
    (b) Powerful tools
    (c) Intuitive Kotlin APIs

3. With Jetpack Compose, we no longer need to design UI with XML. We create their views directly within the Kotlin class, just like we write code.
   
4. We use Jetpack compose because it allows us to write less code; it is intuitive; it accelerates the development process; it is powerful. 

## What is Kotlin?
